# xiv meme hack
i seriously don't know what i even want out of this. 
some ppl code bots that teleport and automatically do shit. 
but the game is actually fun to play. 
so this does a mild amnt of nothing. 
## Features
- Lua Repl (actually really useless)
- Load Lua Scripts (partially done, only loads _boot.lua)
- Ability to inject custom ctxmenu items (aka right click)
- Gather All on leve nodes
- Icon HotSwapper (testing)
- broken Spinbot
