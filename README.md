# xiv meme hack
i seriously don't know what i even want out of this

some ppl code bots that teleport and automatically do shit

but the game is actually fun to play

so this does a whole bunch of nothing
## Features
- Lua Repl (actually really useless)
- Load Lua Scripts (partially done)
- Ability to inject custom ctxmenu items
- glitchy Spinbot
